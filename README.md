This project was developed to facilitate boarding maneuvers by providing fast access to the cameras on a vessel.

In the source code repository there is a circuit schematic, 3D model (for Proteus) and the code for the microcontroller written in C. The system is 8-channel, includes a 16x2 LCD screen and a matrix keyboard. It is based on a PIC 18F4550 microcontroller, but can be downgraded to one with lower specs if needed.
